Level 3 / VISA CEDP
Sample Payload Post Request Parameters

As part of VISA’s updated CEDP (Commercial Enhanced Data Program), Level 3 data is now required for commercial and corporate card transactions to qualify for optimized interchange rates.

To support this, please ensure you are submitting accurate, complete, and properly formatted Level 3 data in your requests. Poor data quality (e.g., missing fields, incorrect values, or placeholder data) may lead to downgraded interchange qualification or rejections.

This includes fields such as item descriptions, quantities, unit costs, tax amounts, and other line-item details. The cleaner and more complete the data, the better the chances of qualifying for enhanced rates.

Include level3CEDPand set it to true to send Level 3 / VISA CEDP fields in the following notification request types to qualify for optimized interchange rates:

1. notifyByReturn – Request

2. notifyBySMS - Request

3. notifyByPost - Request

Here’s a sample request from notifyByReturn with Level 3 / VISA CEDP line items

HPP – queryPaymentStatus API
What is Query API?

Query API lets merchants “pull” information from the gateway. It allows merchant to query the status of payment. Use same transaction reference id used while calling HPP Request Payment Page API. This dataset can then be used to create in-house reports and analytics.

If the requestCardToken field is set to true as part of the Sale transaction request parameters in the getHPP API, the queryPaymentStatus API response will include the cardToken value when the merchant makes the request.

Card Token for Tokenized & Recurring Payments

Get Hosted Payment Page API allows merchants to get a response of card token value/string to use it for further transactions like Sale & Recurring Payments.
In Sale transaction type request payload, if requestCardToken is set to true, iPOS-HPP will respond with card token value as cardToken & consumer id as consumerId. if requestCardToken is set to false, iPOS-HPP will respond, none.

How to Request for a CARD VALIDATION Transaction

The getHostedPaymentPage API allows merchants to validate the card to use it for further transactions like tokenized Sale & Recurring Payments. In the request payload, if transactionType is set to 2, and the amount value is set to 0, iPOS-HPP API will validate the card input entered by the customer on the payment page form.
